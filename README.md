# practice
Based on your repository's current state, here's an assessment and recommendation for next steps toward building an out-of-core tensor contraction package based on the GETT algorithm:

### Current State
- **GETT Implementation:** You have a basic GETT algorithm implemented for GEMM (matrix multiplication) in `src/gett.cpp` and tested in `src/gett_test.cpp`. The implementation operates on in-memory matrices, with support for tiling and packing routines.
- **Reference GEMM & Comparison:** There's a reference GEMM implementation and matrix comparison function for correctness testing.
- **Tensor I/O:** You have HDF5-based routines for saving and loading tensors (`src/readrandomtensor.cpp`, `src/saverandomtensor.cpp`). These support reading/writing large tensors from disk.
- **Tiling Contract Driver:** There's a tiled contraction driver (`src/contract_driver_arrays.cpp`) that uses BLAS for matrix multiplication over tiles, but it assumes everything fits in memory.
- **Main/Test Code:** Your `main.cpp` shows how to create, save, and load random tensors, and sets up basic einsum parsing.

### Next Step: Out-of-Core GETT-Style Tensor Contraction

To move toward a true out-of-core tensor contraction package:
1. **Design Out-of-Core Tiling Strategy:**
   - Instead of assuming all tiles fit in memory, design logic to load only tiles of tensors from disk (HDF5) as needed for each contraction micro-step.
   - For each tile contraction, load the required subtensors from HDF5, contract with GETT, then write the result back to disk.

2. **Implement Out-of-Core Tile Loader:**
   - Create a utility to efficiently read/write tensor tiles (subarrays) from/to disk using HDF5. This will require functions to select hyperslabs in HDF5 files.

3. **Adapt GETT Driver:**
   - Modify your contraction driver (e.g., `contract_with_tiles` or a new function) to use these out-of-core tile loaders.
   - Ensure memory usage is bounded by only keeping a few tiles in memory at a time.

4. **Testing & Benchmarking:**
   - Test your out-of-core contraction on tensors that exceed available RAM.
   - Compare results and performance against your in-core implementation.

### Concretely, the next code step:
**Implement an HDF5 tile loader/saver function and refactor your contraction driver to use it.**

For example, start with a function like:
```cpp
void readTensorTileHDF5(const std::string& filename, const std::string& datasetName,
                        const std::vector<hsize_t>& offset, const std::vector<hsize_t>& count,
                        double* buffer_out);
```
And similarly for writing tiles.

Then update your contraction driver to:
- Loop over output tiles,
- For each tile, read the relevant input slices from disk,
- Perform GETT contraction,
- Write output tile back to disk.

---

**Summary Recommendation:**  
Your next step should be to implement out-of-core tile loading/saving from HDF5 and refactor your contraction logic to operate on disk-resident tensors, processing one tile at a time. This will form the backbone of your scalable, out-of-core tensor contraction package based on the GETT algorithm.

Would you like an example implementation or design sketch for these HDF5 tile utilities?
